        About Me
      </h1>
      <p>
        My first contact with programming was as a teenager, but I got to really explore it in Electrical Engineering college. During my time there I was part of a research lab working with robotics allied to computer vision and did my final project in speech processing using recurrent neural networks.

        Started my professional journey as an intern at a large e-commerce company, being hired shortly after. Had a great experience working with app development and felt like I'd found my calling. Later, I had a terrific opportunity to lead the mobile project on an inventory management tech company with customers from all over the world.

        I'm constantly learning new things, specializing in frontend while broadening my knowledge in other areas. When I'm not working or in front of the computer, you may find me running, riding my bike everywhere, and spending time outdoors in nature. Otherwise, I'm mostly watching movies/series with my wife, cooking, playing the guitar, or entertaining our cat Juju.
