        About Me
      </h1>
      <p>
        My first exposure to programming was as a teenager, but I truly delved into it during my time in Electrical Engineering college. While there, I was part of a research lab focused on robotics combined with computer vision. There I could explore being a maker, working with Arduino, RaspberryPi, ESP8266, 3D printers... We built a custom drone in which I enabled controlling through visual markers using C++ and Python. For my final project, I worked on speech processing with recurrent neural networks by implementing a Google white paper.

      <p>
        During my professional journey I worked on small to large size companies, taking products from 0 to 1 and beyond, leading and collaborating with amazing developers. Recently, my focus has been on contributing to the financial technology services industry through full stack development and engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm constantly learning new things, broadening my knowledge in technology and other areas. Ask me about my AI driven speech side project. When I'm not working or in front of the computer, you may find me reading, playing instruments, exercising and spending time outdoors. But most of the time, I'm invested in being present and enjoying some quality time with my lovely family.
